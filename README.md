# Add Class to Parent Depending on Image Dimensions

Allows you to add classes to html elements with a child images depending on the dimensions of the image. This way, the user can upload long or wide images and classes will be added so you can shift your layout.

1. Add the class 'dim-par' to the parent element you want to add dynamic class.
2. Add the class 'dim-check' to the child <img> element

If the image is long, 'dim-par--long' class will be added to the parent element. If the image is wide, 'dim-par--wide' class will be added.
